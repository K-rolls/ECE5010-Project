# Setup:
if either Node.js or npm are not installed on your machine, follow [this](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-node-js-npm-on-windows) tutorial to install it on your machine. Once completed you can install the project's dependencies, from the root of the project directory:
## *backend*
 - cd backend
 - npm i
## *frontend*
 - cd ../frontend
 - npm i

# Usage:
Once the above packages are installed, open two terminals. In the first terminal, from the root of the project directory, start the server side of the project: 
 - cd .\backend\
 - npm run dev
  
if the following is printed to the terminal you may proceed to starting the client side of the project
